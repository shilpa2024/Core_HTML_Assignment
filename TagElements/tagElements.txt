Elements: Elements are composed of tags and the content they enclose. Elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Elements can be nested inside one another to create a hierarchy in the document structure.

Let's look at an example of an HTML element using the `<a>` (anchor) element:

<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

In this example:
`<a>` is the opening tag for the anchor element.
    `href` is an attribute that specifies the hyperlink's destination (in this case, "https://www.example.com").
    `Visit Example.com` is the content of the anchor element.
    `</a>` is the closing tag for the anchor element.
